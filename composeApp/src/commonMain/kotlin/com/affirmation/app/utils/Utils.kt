        "Believe in yourself",
        "When Sarah first decided to start her own business, everyone told her it was impossible. She had no money, no experience, and no one to guide her. But she believed in herself when no one else did. Every day she faced rejection and failure, yet she kept going, reminding herself that her dreams were worth the fight. Years later, that little idea she held onto turned into a thriving company that inspires others to believe in their own potential. Your journey may be different, but the lesson remains: trust yourself, even when it feels like the world doesn’t."

        "Stay positive and happy",
        "Daniel was stuck in a job he hated and saw no light in his days. One morning, he challenged himself to list three good things daily—simple moments like a warm cup of coffee or a stranger’s smile. At first, it felt forced, but slowly his perspective shifted. He started noticing beauty in small things and learned that happiness doesn’t come from perfect circumstances but from training your mind to see the good even when it’s hard."

    MotivationItem(
        Res.drawable.image3,
        "Work hard and never give up",
        "Maria wanted to run a marathon, but her first training session left her breathless and sore. She thought of quitting countless times, but she kept reminding herself why she started. Day by day, she pushed through the pain, ran a little farther, and grew a little stronger. When she crossed the finish line months later, she realized the marathon wasn’t just about running—it was about proving to herself that persistence beats every obstacle."

        "Be kind whenever possible",
        "James paid for the coffee of the person behind him, not knowing that it would spark a chain of kindness. That person helped a colleague, who then supported a struggling family. Small acts, though often unseen, ripple far beyond what we imagine. Being kind isn’t just about others—it transforms you, too. And sometimes, your smallest gesture becomes someone else’s reason to keep going."

        Res.drawable.image5,
        "Dream big and dare to fail",
        "Liam dreamed of becoming a filmmaker, but with no connections, no equipment, and no experience, everyone told him it was foolish. He started with a cheap camera and made hundreds of unseen, imperfect videos. Every failure became a stepping stone. Years later, those same people who doubted him celebrated his films. Big dreams aren’t about avoiding failure—they’re about daring to fail until success becomes inevitable."

        "Emma believed she wasn’t creative enough to paint. One day, she decided to try anyway. Her first paintings were clumsy and far from perfect, but each canvas revealed something new about herself. Over time, she created works that even she couldn’t believe came from her hands. Our limits are often self-imposed. Once you break them, you’ll discover how boundless your potential really is."

        "When Kevin trained for his first triathlon, he realized the biggest battle wasn’t physical—it was in his head. Every time he wanted to stop, he asked himself, ‘What if I can do just one more step?’ That simple question changed everything. It taught him that growth lives just beyond discomfort. The next time you want to quit, push yourself one step further—you’ll be surprised by what you’re capable of."

        "Clara lived a safe, predictable life until she decided to take a job abroad, leaving everything familiar behind. The first months were scary and lonely, but slowly she grew, learned a new language, made new friends, and discovered strengths she never knew she had. Comfort zones feel safe, but nothing grows there. Step out, and you’ll find a life worth living."

One day, he decided to knock on doors himself—networking, learning, and putting himself out there. The change didn’t happen overnight, but his persistence paid off. Success rarely finds you—you have to chase it with everything you’ve got."

The best time to start living fully is now. Make today count, because tomorrow is never guaranteed."

        "Michael once feared failure so much that he avoided trying new things. But after losing his first startup, he discovered that failure isn’t the opposite of success—it’s part of the journey. Each failure taught him lessons that later built his thriving second business. Embrace failure as your teacher, not your enemy."
